- This is a basic currency convert app using Free Currency API from https://freecurrencyapi.com. Users can convert from a currency to another currency with the rate fetched using Free Currency API.
- To implement and run this app: Basically run the apk file named CurrencyConverter.apk given in this repository.
- Note:
  - This app takes from 5 to 20 seconds in the beginning to fetch Currency List from Free Currency Database, so be patient and wait for it.
  - I tried to create an app with multiple choice of Converter API, but most APIs require paid subscription plan to access all their features. So i made a temporary version with only one choice and can be extend in the future.
  - Biggest challenge was to find a free API.
