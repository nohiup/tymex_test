- This is a basic currency converter app that uses the Free Currency API from https://freecurrencyapi.com. Users can convert one currency to another using the rates fetched from Free Currency API.
- To implement and run this app, simply execute the APK file named CurrencyConverter.apk provided in this repository.
- Note:
  - This app takes between 5 to 20 seconds in the opening to fetch currency list from the Free Currency Database, so please be patient while waiting.
  - I tried to create an app with multiple choices for Converter API, but most APIs require a paid subscription plan to access all their features. Therefore, i created a temporary version with only one choice,, which can be extended in the future.
  - Biggest challenge was finding a free API.
